### Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clone and run your project locally

1. First, make sure that you have Git installed on your computer. If you don't have Git installed, you can download and install it from the official Git website.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

3. Clone the project from my GitHub repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/osama2kabdullah/small-projects.git
```

4. Once the project is cloned, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal or command prompt.
```bash
cd small-projects
```

5. Next, navigate to any project root folder using the command:
```bash
cd <folder name>
```

6. Install the required dependencies for the project by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

7. To run project in locally
```bash
npm start
```

8. That's it! You should now be able to see your project running locally.
